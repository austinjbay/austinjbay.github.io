Hey folks—pull up a chair, and let’s talk about the tech stories that are actually shaping our world… you know, the kind that aren’t just blowing up headlines with hype.

When Spending $155 Billion Is Just the Beginning

It’s astonishing—but not shocking—how tech giants have poured $155 billion into AI this year alone, dwarfing what the U.S. government spends on education, jobs, and social services combined  ￼. That isn’t just money—it’s the underline on a thesis: AI isn’t the future. It’s now.

Silicon Valley Meets Policy at the Whiteboard

In the U.S., markets rallied after President Trump floated a major concession: semiconductor tariffs might not apply to companies investing in U.S. chip manufacturing. Stocks like Apple, Nvidia, AMD, and Broadcom jumped, riding optimism that U.S. production could be rewarded—not punished  ￼.

Meanwhile, back in California, Governor Gavin Newsom has doubled down on AI’s future—partnering with Google, Microsoft, IBM, and Adobe to bring AI training to high schools and colleges statewide  ￼. Not flashy, but deeply important. Tech isn’t just allocation—it’s education.
