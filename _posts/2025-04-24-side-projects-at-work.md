With the demand on product managers from tops-down company initiatives, it's easy to let bottoms-up, experimental ideas fall by the wayside or never even make it into planning ceremonies. 

But sometimes, small sparks from within the team can generate clever solutions to old problems — or at the very least, teach us someting new.

If not for business impact, then just for our own happiness as a team. 

<h2>The problem space</h2>
I'm not a mind reader—and I'm definitely not trying to be—but students have made one thing very clear: staying focused is hard. Between phones that never stop buzzing, group chats that somehow always light up during study time, and the ever-present pressure to be doing <em>all the things</em>, it’s like the universe is running a full-time distraction service made just for them. 

A fall 2024 survey of over 1,000 college students found that 52% have trouble concentrating on tasks <em>several times</em> a week or more. In the same study, 51% of students reported feeing overwhelming stress or anxiety on a weekly basis, showing that over half of college students regularly struggle to focus.<a href="https://kahoot.com/press/2024/10/29/study-habits-snapshot-2024/#:~:text=match%20at%20L142%20challenges%2C%20with,a%20week%20or%20every%20day:"><sup>1</sup></a>

And with +19M college students in the United States, we thought <em>how might we help with time management and focus</em>?
