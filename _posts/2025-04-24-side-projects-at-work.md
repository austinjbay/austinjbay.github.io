At a company like Quizlet, where most of our time is spent focused on core initiatives, it can be easy to let experimental ideas fall  by the wayside or never even make it into a discussion about team priorities. 

But sometimes, small sparks outside of the roadmap can help us find a way forward â€” or at the very least, give us something valuable that we didn't know we needed. 

This past fall, a <a href="https://quizlet.com/features/pomodoro-timer">Pomodoro Timer</a> became a side project we all kind of fell in love with and it reminded us that that sometimes there's a lot of value in exploring ideas outside of the set roadmap. 

If not for business impact, then just for our own happiness as a team. 

<h2>The problem space</h2>
We can't pretend to know more about students lives than what they tell us, but we often hear from students that there are so many distractions they face on a daily basis. From phones that seem to have an endless stream of notifications to pressure from peers to accomplish more, there are so many opportunities on a daily basis for things to disrupt their focus.
