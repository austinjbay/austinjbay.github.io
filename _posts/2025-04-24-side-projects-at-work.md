With the demand on product managers from tops-down company initiatives, it's easy to let bottoms-up, experimental ideas fall by the wayside or never even make it into planning ceremonies. 

But sometimes, small sparks from within the team can generate clever solutions to old problems — or at the very least, teach us something new. 

In a team brainstorm where we workshopped ideas for new growth vectors, this idea of creating a <a href="https://quizlet.com/features/pomodoro-timer">Pomodoro Timer</a> was born. The motivation was relatively simple: time management can feel challening when you're learning something new — but with the right tools, it gets easier and more rewarding. 

<h2>The opportunity space</h2>
Students have made one thing very clear: focus is a commodity with an increasingly high price. Between phones that never stop buzzing, group chats that somehow always light up during study time, and the ever-present pressure to be doing <em>all the things</em>, it’s like the universe is running a full-time distraction service made to drive up the price of focus.

A fall 2024 survey of +1,000 college students found that 52% have trouble concentrating on tasks <em>several times</em> a week or more. In the same study, 51% of students reported feeing overwhelming stress or anxiety on a weekly basis, showing that over half of college students regularly struggle to focus.<a href="https://kahoot.com/press/2024/10/29/study-habits-snapshot-2024/#:~:text=match%20at%20L142%20challenges%2C%20with,a%20week%20or%20every%20day:"><sup>1</sup></a>

There are a lot of areas where our product serves students well today, like memorization, practice problems, and classroom games, but as we workshopped our ideas we stumbled into a shared truth — we had left the herculean challenge of focus to students. 

And in some cases, instead of pushing back distractions with our product, we were introducing our own set of demands.

<h2>Our solution</h2>
Could time management be a growth vector for Quizlet? Are there <em>lightweight</em> ways we might be able to release features that get us closer to answering that question? If so, where do we start and how long do we wait before calling it quits? 

These were just a few of the questions swirling around the team's head. With some data<a href="https://www.thenewshouse.com/campus-news/orange-pulse/students-share-thoughts-on-study-habits-and-procrastination/#:~:text=With%20procrastination%20being%20a%20major,maintain%20concentration%20and%20prevent%20burnout"><sup>1</sup></a> to support that there was a there there, we began to cobble together a Pomodoro experience that we felt good about and along the way, we learned that there's a lot more to interval timers than meets the eye.
