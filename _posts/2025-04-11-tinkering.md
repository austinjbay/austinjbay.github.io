I’ve spent the last decade building and growing products—shipping experiments, moving metrics, celebrating wins, and quietly absorbing the losses. Along the way, I’ve filled countless docs, Notion pages, and Slack DMs with half-formed thoughts, frameworks, and questions I never quite had time to polish or share.

This blog is where I’m finally making space for those thoughts.

I’m a mid-career product leader, focused on growth. That means I spend my days navigating the messy in-between of user needs, business goals, and technical reality. I’ve worked across acquisition, onboarding, retention, SEO, and lifecycle—often switching between strategy and execution in the same meeting. If you know the feeling, this might be the space for you too.

Why now?
Lately, I’ve been craving a slower, more reflective kind of output. Not just slides for exec reviews or one-pagers for cross-functional teams—but something messier and more honest. Writing publicly forces clarity. And I’m hoping it also opens up conversations I haven’t had time (or courage) to start at work.

What you’ll find here
This blog is a digital garden of sorts: evolving, incomplete, and unpolished by design. Expect:

Artifacts from the desk: Docs I’ve made or used to get unstuck—roadmaps, decision trees, hiring rubrics, postmortems, etc.

Field notes: Quick reflections from the week—what worked, what didn’t, what I’m learning (and unlearning).

Mid-career moments: Honest takes on navigating the middle. Plateaus, promotions, reorgs, imposter syndrome, mentorship, and momentum.

Growth strategy thoughts: Things I’ve tried (and whether they worked). SEO, activation loops, onboarding flows, experimentation frameworks.

If you’re a PM, marketer, designer, or just someone figuring out what this part of your career looks like—you’re welcome here.

I don’t have all the answers. But I do have some good questions, a few hard-earned lessons, and a willingness to share what’s on my desk.
