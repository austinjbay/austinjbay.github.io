I’ve spent the last decade helping to build and grow products by shipping a metric ton of experiments, moving metrics, celebrating wins, and learning from losses. Along the way, I’ve filled countless physical notebooks, docs, Notion pages, and Slack DMs with half-formed thoughts, frameworks, and questions I never quite had time to polish or share.

This is where I’m finally making space for those thoughts.

I’m a mid-career product leader, focused on growth. That means I spend my days navigating the messy in-between of user needs, business goals, and technical reality. I’ve worked across acquisition, onboarding, retention, SEO, and lifecycle — often switching between strategy and execution in the same meeting. 

If you know the feeling, this might be the space for you too.

<h2>Why now?</h2>
Lately, I’ve been craving a slower, more reflective kind of output. Not just slides for exec reviews or one-pagers for cross-functional teams—but something messier and more honest. Writing publicly forces clarity. And I’m hoping it also opens up conversations I haven’t had time (or courage) to start at work.

<h2>What you’ll find here</h2>  
This blog is a digital garden of sorts: evolving, incomplete, and unpolished by design. 

Expect:
<ul>

  <li>Artifacts from the desk: Docs I’ve made or used to get unstuck—roadmaps, decision trees, hiring rubrics, postmortems, etc.</li>

  <li>Field notes: Quick reflections from the week—what worked, what didn’t, what I’m learning (and unlearning).</li>

  <li>Mid-career moments: Honest takes on navigating the middle. Plateaus, promotions, reorgs, imposter syndrome, mentorship, and momentum.</li>

  <li>Growth strategy thoughts: Things I’ve tried (and whether they worked). SEO, activation loops, onboarding flows, experimentation frameworks.</li>

</ul>

If you’re a PM, marketer, designer, or just someone figuring out what this part of your career looks like — you’re welcome here.

I don’t have all the answers. But I do have some good questions, a few hard-earned lessons, and a willingness to share what’s on my desk.
